Files in the "g" directory I consider to be "good": 
Your program should definitely support them if it claims to support BMP.

Files in the "q" directory I consider to be "questionable":
They may technically violate the documentation in some way, but your program
should probably still do its best to support them.

Files in the "q" directory are "bad":
They are clearly invalid. Make sure your program doesn't crash when reading
them.
